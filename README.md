live wind from poole harbour

why

As a keen local kitesurfer I visit the awesome www.pooleharbourweather.com almost daily. Thing is, being flash based it doesn't work on many mobiles so I decided to hack together this app. Very beta but should work well on tiny and huge screens...Hope you find it useful! 

As a developer it was an opportunity to hack around with some new tech: firebase, angular, topcoat.io, vector charting with morris.js, node on azure...
